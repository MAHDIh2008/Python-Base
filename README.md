# 🐍 Python Base – Project Playlist

Welcome to **Python Base**, a personal learning repository where I built multiple mini-projects using Python to master:

- 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- 💾 File Handling
- ⚙️ Real-World Problem Solving

Each folder is a self-contained mini-app and represents **one focused day of learning** – like a structured playlist.

## 📌 Why I Built This

As a developer and trader, I believe building is the fastest path to learning. These projects helped me:

- ✅ Think in terms of **objects and responsibilities**
- ✅ Apply **error handling and input validation**
- ✅ Practice **code organization**
- ✅ Improve problem-solving using **real-life scenarios**

- 💾 Data persistence using **CSV / JSON**
- 🔍 Easy-to-understand structure for beginners
- 🧱 Great foundation for scaling to **full-stack apps**
