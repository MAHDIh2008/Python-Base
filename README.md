# 🐍 Python Base – Project Playlist

Welcome to **Python Base**, a personal learning repository where I built multiple mini-projects using Python to master **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, and **real-world problem-solving** techniques.

Each folder is a mini-app and represents 1 focused day of learning. This is like a structured playlist for learning through building — step by step.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- ✅ Fully working CLI-based apps
- 🧠 Applied OOP concepts (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
- 💾 Data saved with CSV, JSON, or in memory
- 🧪 Easy to test and improve further
- 🧱 Great as a foundation for scaling to full-stack projects

## 🚀 How to Run a Project

Each project is self-contained. To run one:

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Day01_Bank_Account_Manager
   python BankAccountManager.py

📌 Why I Built This
As a developer and trader, I believe building is the fastest path to learning.
These projects helped me:

Think in terms of objects and responsibilities

Use error handling and input validation

Practice code organization

Improve problem-solving through real scenarios
